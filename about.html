            <h2>ABOUT ALESSIO ALBI</h2>
            <p>Born in Staffordshire, England. Alessio Albi first picked up a camera at the early age of fourteen -
                influenced by self-portraiture and conceptual photography. Growing up with the rise of social media
                and digital techniques enabled Lara to see the bigger picture of an international industry. After
                graduating college she made the move to London, where she naturally felt the transition to fashion
                photography. A couple of years later - she embarked on her first trip to New York and never looked
                back.
                <br>
                Lara enjoys creating timeless and emotive imagery. She is inspired by feminine strength, unique
                beauty and lasting style.
                <br>
                She currently resides in NYC and regularly travels for assignments, working between NY, LA and
                London.
                <br>
                Lara also enjoys teaching & speaking at photography conventions and runs her own photography
                education business Alessio Albi Education. Her love of education has been recognized by some of the
                largest brands in photography and most recently she was named a Canon Explorer Of Light.
